# Campus Club Year Plans

Mozilla Campus Clubs create year plans that give direction and clarity to everyone in the Club on what the Club is aiming towards this year. This year plan will be a document that is referenced widely when planning activities and when you evaluate the performance of your Club throughout the year.

You can add your Year Plan directly as an issue or you can create it in Google Docs using the link below and add it to an issue. 

Or you can use this google doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DKQd0decBLoAMep6weXINDP4zrURFbhHl7061SO5UYA/copy)
